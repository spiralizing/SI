**Supporting Information**, here are the graphs for the fluctuation functions.

The graphs are labeled as following:

* Palestrina Motets: PalestrinaMo-#
* Bach Musical Offering: BachMO-#
* Bach Well Tempered Clavier: BachWTK-#
* Haydn String Quartets: HaydnSQ-#
* Mozart Piano Sonatas: MozartPS-#
* Mozart String Quartets: MozartSQ-#
* Beethoven Fugues: BeethovenF-#
* Beethoven Early Quartets: BeethovenEQ-#
* Beethoven Late Quartets: BeethovenLQ-#
* Dvorak Humoresques: DvorakH-#
* Dvorak Silhouettes: DvorakS-#
* Dvorak Serenade for Strings: DvorakSt-#
* Shostakovich Preludes and Fugues: ShostakovichPF-#

The number corresponds to the place in the full list of opus. 

Files corresponding to a scaling behavior over all *s* boxes (profile 1) are in Scaling.pdf, files corresponding to the functions showing a crossover (profiles 1 and 2) are in Crossovers.pdf, the files with the graps of profiles 4 and 5 are in NoScaling.pdf

The values of the alpha's and R squared for the linear fitting in the fluctuations function are on the Tables: TableScaling.pdf corresponds to the functions following a power law and TableCrossovers.pdf to the functions with a crossover.
